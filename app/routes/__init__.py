"""
    Purpose: The routes directory in FastAPI contains the definitions of our API endpoints
    Each route corresponds to a specific URL path and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that clients can use to interact with our webapplication
    routes are where we define the logic that handles requests and generates responses
    
    Usage: routes map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate function or class method that processes the request 
    These routes are the entry points of our web application, defining how clients can interact with our APIs
